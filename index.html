  <h1>Do Americans watch foreign movies? </h1>
  <p>Do you remember the times when you were in college and the film festival time comes? In Istanbul students were often looking to buy tickets in advance, make their weekly plan, mostly to see art house films in theaters. Because rest of the time it was almost impossible to find current European film in box office. Do you know why? It was all American and Turkish films! I’m sure Americans don’t watch Turkish films but how about foreign films in general? Do they also enjoy reading those subtitles?</p></center>

<center> <p>To understand what is really happening in the U.S, I searched for the biggest movie theaters in east and west coasts. According to Forbes Magazine AMC Loews Lincoln, N.Y and Arclight Cinemas Hollywood, Los Angeles are at the top of the list. I looked at the movies in theaters at the last week of November. (see Graph 1 for the list) In both N.Y and L.A there was no foreign language film but one multilingual film. Which is a mixture of Spanish and English. In L.A 1/9 of the films is multilingual, conversely in N.Y only 1/12 is multilingual. Which makes %8 to %11. (see Graph 2 for the chart) It’s a slight difference among theaters. But thinking about how foreign language film presented in the U.S, it’s engrossing.</p></center>

<center> <p>Seems like while rest of the world seeing American Culture on the silver screen, Americans don’t care about us. It’s a pity for cultural interaction and diversity. Cultures flourish by touching and building empathy in between.</p></center>
